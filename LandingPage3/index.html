                    <h3 class="article-subtitle"><i class='bx bx-radio-circle' ></i>What is C?</h3>

                    <p>C is a powerful and widely-used procedural programming language originally developed by Dennis
                        Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is a middle-level language, combining the features
                        of both high-level languages (such as Python or Java) and low-level languages (such as assembly
                        language), making it suitable for system programming as well as application programming.
                        Uses of C</p>

                    <p>C is widely used in various domains due to its versatility and efficiency. Some of its common
